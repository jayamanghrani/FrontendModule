Why we are using  bootstarp only, there will be other option also?

1. easy to use-- for bootstrap we have proper documentation available on internet, 
                beacuse it launched on 2011.bootstarp is the product of twitter.
                and twitter is leading company.

                like react is product of facebok.


 2. Browser Compatability--current version of bootstrap is 5.
                         support all browser except Internet explorer.   
                         
3. Give responsive feature with minimum coding.
