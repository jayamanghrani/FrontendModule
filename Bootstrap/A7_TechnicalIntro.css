 *TODO---> 2 imp -->Bootstrap Classes(css class which bootstrap has created for us ) + Grid system

*? Bootstrap classes
 

*? In bootstrap we have around 4000 class, but 4 are very imp-

       1. "Container" or "Container-fluid"
       2. "row"
       3. "col"



      *? What is Container?
      component of web page , where we keep all our content.


      *?Why required container?, what facilities given by bootstrap container?
      1. wrap and contain our content, hmara data webpage se overflow nhi hoga.
      2. provide padding(inside space in container and content) and margin(outside space in container) to our container.
      3. help us center our content on the page.ex. https://jqueryuk.com
      4.container are of 7 types but two are imp i.e--[fluid or fixed]


      *?The class "container"

      a) provide a responsive fixedwidth container.

                     fixedwidth means at in range screen size, it will keep it's size fixed.
