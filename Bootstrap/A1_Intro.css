Bootstrap

    open source(means it's code is freely available on internet)
    HTML, CSS, Javascript framework for building responsive application on the web

 Before bootstrap,
 
        users was accessing applcation on desktop/laptop.
        For mobile, developer was creating different application.
        ex facebook---
        desktop/laptop--facebook.com
        mobile-m.facebook.com

        But after mobile, tablet, smart telivesion, watch came.
        By this way developer will have to create different application for all devices.

So they came up with solution ---
        To build smart website i.e. responsive website, 
        which can adjust itelf according to the device screen size.

 
 We have alternate option other than bootstrap --
         media queries in css(@media)
    
    
  But if we will use bootstrap , they will handle media queries internally.
