//! What is web api
/* is an application programming interface which is used either for web server or a web browser.

Two types of web api are--
1. server-side API
2.Client-side API-------ex. DOM 

The reason the Java APIs are called server-side APIs is 
because the code executes on the server before it is sent to the browser. ...
 These are called client-side APIs because they are interpreted by the browsers.
